<h3 class="text-left">About</h3>
<P>Established on the 8th January 2024, Print Modular was created from the ingenuity and ease in prototyping and production that 3D printing brings. What started as one 3D printer jammed to one side of my home office desk setup, is still that today, but I hope to soon add more 3D printers to the setup to increase production.
